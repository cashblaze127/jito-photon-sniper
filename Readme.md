## Prerequisites

- Node.js (20.18.0 or higher)
- Solana CLI tools
- A Solana wallet with sufficient SOL
- Jito access (for MEV capabilities)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:cashblaze127/jito-photon-sniper.git
cd jito-photon-sniper
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following configuration:
```env
SOLANA_RPC=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
IS_DEVNET=false
SLIPPAGE_BPS=10
JITO_TIP_MULT=20
WALLETS_FILE=wallets.txt
PRIORITY_FEE=2000
```

4. Create a `wallets.txt` file with your wallet information in the following format:
```
<public_key>,<private_key>,<amount_in_sol>
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `SOLANA_RPC`: Your Solana RPC endpoint
- `IS_DEVNET`: Set to 'true' for devnet testing
- `SLIPPAGE_BPS`: Slippage tolerance in basis points (default: 100 = 1%)
- `JITO_TIP_MULT`: Multiplier for Jito tips
- `WALLETS_FILE`: Path to your wallets file
- `PRIORITY_FEE`: Priority fee in microlamports

### Wallet Configuration

The `wallets.txt` file should contain one wallet per line in the format:
```
public_key,private_key,amount_in_sol
```

Example:
```
ABC123...,XYZ789...,1.5
DEF456...,UVW321...,2.0
```

## Usage

1. Start the bot:
```bash
npm start
```

2. The bot will:
   - Load wallet configurations
   - Calculate total SOL injection
   - Prioritize wallets based on configuration
   - Begin parallel execution of buy orders
   - Automatically retry failed transactions
   - Monitor and report transaction status

## How It Works

1. **Wallet Loading**: The bot loads wallet configurations from `wallets.txt`
2. **Priority Calculation**: Wallets are prioritized based on:
   - Priority fee (increases with wallet position)
   - Jito tip multiplier
   - Estimated price impact
3. **Transaction Preparation**:
   - Creates Photon swap instructions
   - Sets compute unit limits and priority fees
   - Handles ATA (Associated Token Account) creation
4. **Execution**:
   - Sends transactions through Jito's MEV infrastructure
   - Implements parallel processing for multiple wallets
   - Includes automatic retry mechanism for failed transactions

## Security Considerations

- Never share your private keys
- Use a dedicated wallet for the bot
- Monitor transaction fees and slippage
- Keep your `.env` file secure
- Regularly update dependencies
